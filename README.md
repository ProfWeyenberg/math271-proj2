[![GitHub Classroom Workflow](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml)

The classroom autograder action will install any packages listed in the PACKAGES file (one per line) before attempting to knit.

## Project Outline

In this project you will work with a partner to work through a complete data collection and analysis exercise. Each partner will write an individual report, but you will collaborate to decide on what data to collect, and on collecting the data itself.

1. Identify a question about how you and your partner use time that you are comfortable sharing with the class.
2. Use a calendar app such as Google Calendar, OSX Calendar, or Outlook, to make a log of relevant activities.
3. Export the calendar to a standard format like `.ics` and exchange your log with your partner.
4. Import the calendar data into R and wrangle it into shape.
5. Visualize and analyze the data using an inference technique from the class.
6. Prepare a short report about your question, data, analysis, and interpretation of the results.
7. As a team, prepare a short reflection document on the experience of consciously collecting and sharing data about yourself.
